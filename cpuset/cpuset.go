// Package cpuset partitions a machine's CPU cores between the kvbench load
// generator and the RESP server it launches, so a co-located run on a multi-core
// box does not let the client steal the cores the server needs.
//
// This closes a real measurement flaw in the network class. kvbench launches a
// RESP server as a child process and drives it with the go-redis client from the
// same process, over a private unix socket. Without pinning, the client
// goroutines and the server threads land on the same cores and fight for them.
// The fight depresses the measured throughput, and it does so unevenly: a
// single-threaded server such as redis only ever wants one core, so a co-located
// go-redis client barely disturbs it, while a multi-threaded server such as
// kv-redis or aki can claim the spare cores the client also wants. The result is
// a ranking that partly reflects who grabbed the idle cores rather than who
// serves the protocol faster. Pinning the two sides to disjoint core sets removes
// the contention and gives every server the same core budget, the way
// redis-benchmark keeps its load threads off the server's cores.
//
// The cleanest fix is still to run the client on a separate box. Partitioning is
// the fix for the common case where only one box is available.
